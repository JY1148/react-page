          5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
        </p>

        <p>
          In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system

        <p>
          We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
          measures designed to protect the security of any personal information
          we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
          information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
          information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
          we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
          unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security,
          and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
          Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
          transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at
          your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
          environment.

          time. If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are
          unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the

          7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
        </p>

        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or
          setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
          data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
          this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
          currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
          automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
          standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
          future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
          this privacy notice.{" "}

          information about categories of personal information (if any) we

          and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal
          information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a
          California resident and would like to make such a request, please
          submit your request in writing to us using the contact information
          provided below.
